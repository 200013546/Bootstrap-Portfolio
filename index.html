            <p>I have been working in IT for the last 25 years. I have coded many applications over the years which I
              learned on my own and have done well enough to get by. When the email came from our HR department
              explaining an opportunity for a Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp, it sounded interesting. As I looked at the
              details of the class, I discovered the skills that it taught and thought it seemed like really good
              things to know, I figured I already knew enough and could not commit to that much time. The email
              provided a link to a basic coding aptitude test and I wanted to see how well I could do. It requested an
              email address and I expected that it would send me the results. I took the brief test and I felt good
              about how I did. After completion, I looked for an email response. Not finding one, I shrugged and went
              upon my daily work. After about three weeks I found I had been selected to attend the class. At first I
              thought this was a mistake. I had not signed up for this. Since it was late in the day, I decided to wait
              until the next day to respond that I would not be attending the class. When the next day came, a long
              time co-worker of mine mentioned that he saw that I was attending the class and he was in it too. I told
              him that I could not commit to the time. He explained how it was a great opportunity. I thought about
              what he said, called home to clear it with my family. They agreed that it would be a great opportunity. I
              then filled out the application. </p>
            <p>Since the first day, my mind has been so enlightened. Coding I had done in the past without
              understanding was all explained. It's been so exciting to learn new technology for coding. I shudder to
              think that I was going to pass up on such a great opportunity to learn so much. The class has moved fast,
              taken much time and effort, but has been so rewarding. The support has been the best. A great instructor
              that has explained the concepts clearly and verified understanding. Teacher assistants, online tutors,
              personal tutors and support staff have facilitated all learning aspects and have ensured that it be a
              great experience.</p>
            <p>My advice to anyone thinking of taking a program like this would be to absolutely consider it. Make the
              time and commitment. Go to class, study the material. The time goes so fast. It will empower you with
              confidence, skills and abilities to help you in your future career.</p>
